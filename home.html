            <h3>Things Bonya likes to do:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Bark loudly when someone's at the door.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Happily jump and make endless circles when one of us enter the house.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run to kitchen when she hears signs of feeding her.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Things Casper likes to do:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Sleep all day long, snoring and making weird sounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cry as if he was not given food at least for 3 days when he is hungry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Walk with his fluffy tail up in a magestical way as if he owns the house.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p> I love my babies, I have had many dogs in my life and this is my second cat as well. <br>
            Definately I am more of a cat person now but they are so adorable and different by character and as creatures.</p>
